# NOTE: 
#
# This code was originally located in torizon_base_image_type.inc, which is included 
# by the class image_type_torizon.bbclass. As the class is added to IMAGE_CLASSES, it is
# parsed by every image recipe several times. There are 100+ image recipes in the layers
# used by the torizon distro. When building the torizon-minimal image, the function get_layer_revision_information
# was executed 350+ times in the step "Parsing recipes". Parsing took 10 minutes longer than normal.
#
# The function get_layer_revision_information executes the same information for every image
# recipe. For every layer repository, it calculates the commit sha. The commit sha's don't 
# change during a bitbake run. In short, get_layer_revision_information must only be executed
# once for every build.
#
# By inheriting ostree_layer_revision_info (this class) in torizon-base.inc, which is required 
# by the torizon image, the function get_layer_revision_information is executed exactly once.
